# pi_gpio_gui
```
This project is intended to aid in prototyping and experimenting on a raspberry pi using the GPIO pins. It is a GUI built with Electron.js and Vue.js. The Gpio pins are accessible using the johnny-five framework.

NOTE: The raspi-io plugin for johnny-five must be installed on the board (raspberry pi) in order to use the gpio pins.
It will only install on properly on supported boards (not laptop/PC).

To install using npm run: npm install raspi-io
